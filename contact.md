## How I Can Help

**Technical Accounting Questions**
Stuck on a tricky US GAAP, IFRS, or Ind AS issue? I've been there. Let me help you navigate revenue recognition, lease accounting, or financial instruments.

**Audit & Compliance Support**
{% assign years = 'now' | date: "%Y" | minus: site.author.career_start_year %}
Need support with statutory audits, internal controls, or SOX compliance? I bring {{ years }}+ years of audit experience to help you through it.

**Strategic Finance Guidance**
Transitioning to FP&A? Building financial models? I'm figuring this out myself and happy to share what I'm learning about driver-based modeling, scenario planning, and strategic thinking.

**Career Conversations**
Want to chat about the CA journey, FP&A transitions, or building your CFO roadmap? I'm always happy to connect with fellow finance professionals.
