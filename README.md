# 🧭 The Finance & Strategy Journal
**By [Sakshi Jain, CA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/casakshijain907/)**

Welcome to my digital garden. This repository powers my personal blog, where I document the evolution of a Chartered Accountant from **Technical Compliance (Audit & GAAP)** to **Strategic Leadership (FP&A & CFO Roadmap)**.

---

## 📖 Goal
This platform serves as a bridge between **compliance-based accounting** and **forward-looking business strategy**. It is designed for finance professionals who believe that the "Why" behind the numbers is just as important as the "What."

### 🎯 Core Knowledge Pillars
* **Global Reporting:** Technical deep-dives into **US GAAP, IFRS, and Ind AS**.
* **Governance:** Insights from 6+ years in **Audit** to ensure financial hygiene.
* **The FP&A Pivot:** Moving from historical recording to **predictive forecasting** and driver-based modeling.
* **CFO Roadmap:** Mastering the tech-stack (Power BI/Tableau) and commercial acumen required for modern finance leadership.
