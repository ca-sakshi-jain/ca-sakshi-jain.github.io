## The New Era of Financial Reporting: Understanding Ind AS 118

The landscape of financial reporting in India is about to undergo its most significant transformation since the initial transition to Ind AS. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has issued the **Exposure Draft of Ind AS 118, *Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements***.

Replacing the long-standing **Ind AS 1**, this new standard isn't just a simple update—it is a complete overhaul of how performance is presented and communicated. If you are involved in the financial reporting process, here is everything you need to know about the upcoming shift.

## What is Ind AS 118?

Ind AS 118 is the Indian equivalent of the global **IFRS 18**. Its primary goal is to reduce the "diversity" in how companies present their Profit or Loss (P&L) accounts. While it **does not change how you measure** profit (the "bottom line" remains the same), it drastically changes **how you show** that profit to the world.

### Key Changes to the Financial Statements

The most visible changes will occur in the **Statement of Profit and Loss**, which will now be divided into **five distinct categories**:

1. **Operating Category:** This is now the "default" bucket for all income and expenses not classified elsewhere. It provides a "complete picture" of a company's operations.


2. **Investing Category:** Includes returns from assets that generate income independently, such as dividends from shares or rentals from investment property.


3. **Financing Category:** Covers interest expenses and income on liabilities like bank loans, bonds, and lease liabilities.


4. **Income Taxes Category:** Tax expenses recognized under Ind AS 12.


5. **Discontinued Operations Category:** Results from operations being shut down or sold.



**New Required Subtotals:**
To improve comparability, all companies must now present two new subtotals:

* **Operating Profit or Loss**.
* **Profit or Loss before Financing and Income Taxes**.

## Implementation & Timeline

Don't panic just yet—you have time to prepare.

* **Effective Date:** The proposed effective date in India is for annual reporting periods beginning on or after **April 1, 2027**.
* **Comparative Information:** When the standard kicks in, you will need to restate your previous year's figures (2026-27) to match the new format.

## Advantages for Users (Investors & Analysts)

* **Better Comparability:** Currently, two companies in the same industry might define "Operating Profit" differently. Ind AS 118 mandates a consistent structure, making "apples-to-apples" comparisons easier.


* **Transparency in "Management Numbers":** Many companies use non-standard metrics (like "Adjusted EBITDA") in press releases. Ind AS 118 introduces **Management-defined Performance Measures (MPMs)**. If a company uses these "alternative" totals in public, they **must** now disclose them in a single note in the audited financial statements and reconcile them back to the official Ind AS totals.

## Potential Complications for Companies

While the standard brings clarity, the transition phase will have its hurdles:

### 1. The "Mixed" Presentation Challenge

Companies must decide whether to present expenses by **Nature** (e.g., raw materials, employee costs) or **Function** (e.g., cost of sales, distribution costs). Ind AS 118 allows a "mixed" presentation if it provides more useful info, but this requires significant judgment and internal data restructuring.

### 2. Identifying "Main Business Activities"

For most, interest is a "Financing" item. However, for **banks or finance companies**, providing credit is their *operating* activity. These entities must assess their "Main Business Activity" to determine if interest/investing income should actually move into the Operating category.

### 3. Impact on IT Systems

ERP systems currently mapped to Ind AS 1 categories will need to be reconfigured to track and bucket expenses into the five new categories automatically.

## Case Study Perspective: The "Adjusted Profit" Transparency

Imagine a tech startup that consistently highlights **"Core Operating Profit"** in its investor decks by excluding share-based payments and certain legal costs.

* **Under Old Rules:** This "Core" figure lived only in the presentation deck, often without a clear link to the audited P&L.
* **Under Ind AS 118:** This figure is now an **MPM**. The company must include a note in the audited financials explaining how it's calculated and—most importantly—reconcile it to the official "Operating Profit," including the tax effect of those adjustments.



## Next Steps

This standard represents a shift toward more disciplined communication. Companies should begin by:

* Reviewing their current P&L structure against the five new categories.
* Identifying any MPMs used in previous investor presentations.
* Assessing if their internal reporting matches the proposed "Operating Profit" definition.
