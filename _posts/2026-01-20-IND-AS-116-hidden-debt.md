If you think a lease is just a monthly **“rent expense,”** your financial ratios are probably outdated.

In today’s regulatory environment, **simple rent has evolved into a capital allocation decision**, one that directly impacts leverage, EBITDA, covenants, and strategic planning.

Today, we bridge the gap between **Audit compliance** and **FP&A strategy** by decoding **Lease Accounting under Ind AS 116 / IFRS 16**.

## 1️⃣ The Accounting Shift: No More Off-Balance Sheet

Under the old lease standards, operating leases were easy:

- Pay rent  
- Book an expense  
- Keep it *off the balance sheet*

Under **Ind AS 116**, that simplicity is gone.

Every lease is now treated as a **financed purchase**.

### What changes?

- **Right-of-Use (ROU) Asset**  
  You recognize the economic right to use the office, warehouse, or equipment.

- **Lease Liability**  
  You recognize the **present value of future lease payments** as debt.

📌 *What used to be invisible leverage is now explicit financial risk.*

## 2️⃣ The EBITDA Illusion 📈

This change isn’t just cosmetic, it fundamentally alters your **P&L structure**.

### Earlier (Pre-Ind AS 116)
- Rent expense  
- Classified as **Operating Expense (above EBITDA)**

### Now (Ind AS 116)
- Rent split into:
  - **Depreciation** (ROU Asset)
  - **Interest Expense** (Lease Liability)

### The result?

- ✅ **EBITDA improves automatically**
- ❌ **Interest costs rise**
- ❌ **Leverage ratios worsen**

🚨 EBITDA growth here is **accounting-driven**, not performance-driven.

## 3️⃣ The FP&A vs Audit Conflict ⚔️

This is where friction begins—because **compliance and strategy see leases very differently**.

### 🔍 Auditor’s Perspective (Backward-Looking)
- Precision and defensibility
- Heavy scrutiny on:
  - **Incremental Borrowing Rate (IBR)**
  - **Lease term assumptions**
- A lower IBR inflates liabilities  
- A higher IBR understates them

### 📊 FP&A Perspective (Forward-Looking)
- Impact on:
  - Debt-to-Equity
  - ROIC
  - Covenant compliance
- A lease that once looked “cheap” may now:
  - Break covenants
  - Reduce project ROI
  - Consume balance-sheet capacity

💥 Same numbers. Very different consequences.

## 🛠️ The Professional Playbook

### 🔍 For Auditors: Getting SAAE (Sufficient Appropriate Audit Evidence)

Key audit procedures include:

- **Completeness Testing**  
  Scan the P&L for rent, AMC, or facility expenses that may hide uncapitalized leases.

- **Discount Rate Validation**  
  Validate the IBR using:
  - Bank sanction letters
  - Comparable borrowing rates
  - Yield curves for similar credit profiles

- **Lease Term Judgment**  
  Economic reality matters.  
  If a company invests heavily in fit-outs for a 3-year lease, extension is likely not optional.

---

### 📊 For FP&A Leaders: Your Model Must Evolve

- **Double-Layer Forecasting**  
  Each lease now needs:
  - Depreciation forecast
  - Interest amortization schedule

- **CapEx vs OpEx Reclassification**  
  Leasing now consumes **debt capacity**, not just cash flow.

- **KPI Recalibration**  
  Educate leadership:
  - EBITDA growth ≠ operational improvement
  - Track **EBITDAR** for true performance comparison

## 🌍 Global Quick-Take: Ind AS vs US GAAP

| Standard | Lease Treatment | Expense Pattern |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Ind AS / IFRS 16** | Single finance-lease model | Front-loaded |
| **US GAAP (ASC 842)** | Operating leases still allowed | Straight-lined |

📌 Same economics, different optics.

## 💡 Strategic Takeaway

Ind AS 116 transformed **rent** from a procurement decision into a **capital allocation decision**.

Every CFO must now ask:

> *Does it still make sense to lease—or should the comapany buy?*
