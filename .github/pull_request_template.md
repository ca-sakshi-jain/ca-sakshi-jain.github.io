This PR converts the existing IndAS-115-and-IFRS-15 article into a proper Jekyll blog post (with front-matter), moves it into _posts/, and sets up the repository for future maintainable blog use by a Chartered Accountant. SEO and reader-friendly improvements included.

After merging, new posts can be added by copying markdown files into _posts/. This also prepares the blog for easy content updates by non-technical users.
