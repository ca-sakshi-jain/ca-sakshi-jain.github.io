On January 15, 2026, the Supreme Court of India delivered a verdict that fundamentally rewrites the playbook for foreign investment in India. By upholding a **₹14,500 crore ($1.7 billion)** tax demand against Tiger Global, the Court has signaled that "Substance" is now the only currency that matters in Indian tax treaty claims.

## 1. The Case Timeline: What Happened?

The dispute traces back to one of India's most successful startup exits.

* **2011–2015:** Tiger Global (US-based) invested in **Flipkart** using a multi-layered structure. They didn't invest directly; they set up three entities in **Mauritius**, which held shares in a **Singapore** holding company, which in turn owned the Indian operating entity.
* **2018:** During Walmart’s $16 billion acquisition of Flipkart, the Tiger Global Mauritius entities sold their Singapore shares.
* **The Claim:** Tiger Global claimed 0% capital gains tax under the India-Mauritius DTAA, arguing the investments were "grandfathered" (made before April 2017).
* **The Result:** The Supreme Court overturned the Delhi High Court's favor, ruling the structure was an **"impermissible tax avoidance arrangement."**

## 2. Why the TRC Exemption was Disallowed

For decades, the **Tax Residency Certificate (TRC)** was considered a "sacrosanct" shield. The SC has now clarified it is merely a "passport"—not a guarantee of entry.

### The "Head & Brain" Test
The Revenue proved that the Mauritius entities were effectively "empty shells." No independent employees or managers were making investment decisions in Mauritius. Evidence showed that all key decisions were made by the US-based team.

### The "Conduit" Finding
The Court classified these entities as mere "pass-throughs." They lacked **Commercial Substance**—meaning they existed solely to facilitate the tax-free flow of capital rather than conducting actual business operations in Mauritius.

### GAAR Overlap
In a significant move, the Court ruled that **GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rules)** can be applied to deny treaty benefits even if the investment date predates the law, provided the *exit* or *arrangement* is found to be abusive.

## 3. The Global Connection: US → Mauritius → Singapore → India

This case highlights how tax authorities now "look through" complex jurisdictional webs to find the economic source.

| Country | Role in the Case | Why it mattered to the SC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **USA** | **Control Center** | The "Head & Brain" lived here. SC ruled the US parent was the real investor. |
| **Mauritius** | **Treaty Shield** | The "Tax Home" on paper. SC ruled this was an artificial stop to access 0% tax. |
| **Singapore** | **Holding Hub** | Where Flipkart was legally parented. SC applied "Indirect Transfer" rules. |
| **India** | **Economic Source** | Where the actual value was created. SC ruled India has the primary right to tax. |

## Conclusion: The New Reality

The Tiger Global ruling marks the definitive end of the "Form over Substance" era. For PE/VC funds and MNCs, the message is clear: 
> **"Possessing a TRC is the beginning of the conversation, not the end of it."**

Investors must now ensure their offshore structures have genuine management, local decision-making authority, and a clear commercial rationale beyond just tax savings.
