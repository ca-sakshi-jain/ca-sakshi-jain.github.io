India’s financial reporting landscape is poised for a major overhaul, marking the most significant transformation since the initial transition to Ind AS. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has released the **Exposure Draft of Ind AS 118, *Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements***.

This new standard replaces the longstanding Ind AS 1 and represents a comprehensive overhaul of how performance is presented and communicated. Financial reporting professionals should be well-informed about this upcoming shift.

## What is Ind AS 118?

Ind AS 118 serves as India’s counterpart to the global **IFRS 18**. Its primary objective is to reduce the diversity in how companies present their Profit or Loss (P&L) accounts. While it doesn’t alter the measurement of profit (the bottom line remains unchanged), it significantly alters how that profit is presented to the global audience.

### Key Financial Statement Changes

The most noticeable changes will occur in the **Statement of Profit and Loss**, which will now be divided into five distinct categories:

1. **Operating Category:** This category will serve as the default for all income and expenses not classified elsewhere. It provides a comprehensive view of a company’s operational activities.

2. **Investing Category:** This category includes returns from assets that generate income independently, such as dividends from shares or rental income from investment property.

3. **Financing Category:** This covers interest expenses and income on liabilities such as bank loans bonds and lease liabilities.

4. **Income Taxes Category:** This includes tax expenses recognised under Ind AS 12.

5. **Discontinued Operations Category:** This reflects the results of operations being discontinued or sold.

**New Required Subtotals:**
To enhance comparability, all companies must now present two new subtotals:

* **Operating Profit or Loss**. This will be the profit or loss from the “Operating” category, excluding any financing and tax impacts.
* **Profit or Loss before Financing and Income Taxes**.
These subtotals will provide investors with a clearer picture of a company’s core operational performance, separate from financing and tax impacts.

## Implementation & Timeline

Don’t worry, you have ample time to prepare.

* **Effective Date:** The proposed effective date in India is for annual reporting periods commencing on or after **April 1, 2027**.
* **Comparative Information:** When the standard takes effect you’ll need to restate your figures for the previous year (2026-27) to align with the new format.


## Advantages for Users (Investors & Analysts)

* **Improved Comparability:** Currently, two companies within the same industry might define “Operating Profit” differently. Ind AS 118 mandates a consistent structure, simplifying “apples-to-apples” comparisons.

* **Enhanced Transparency in “Management Numbers”:** Many companies use non-standard metrics like “Adjusted EBITDA” in press releases. Ind AS 118 introduces **Management-defined Performance Measures (MPMs)**. If a company uses these “alternative” totals in public they must now disclose them in a single note within the audited financial statements and reconcile them back to the official Ind AS totals.

## Potential Complications for Companies

While the standard provides clarity, the transition phase presents several challenges:

### 1. The “Mixed” Presentation Dilemma

Companies face a choice between presenting expenses by **Nature** (e.g. raw materials and employee costs) or **Function** (e.g. cost of sales and distribution costs). Ind AS 118 permits a “mixed” presentation if it offers more useful information but demands significant judgement and internal data restructuring.

### 2. Determining “Main Business Activities”

For most companies, interest is classified as a “Financing” item. However, for banks and finance companies, providing credit constitutes their *operating* activity. These entities must evaluate their “Main Business Activity” to decide whether interest and investing income should be categorised as Operating.

### 3. IT System Adjustments

ERP systems currently mapped to Ind AS 1 categories will need reconfiguration to automatically track and categorise expenses into the five new categories.

### 4. Audit Disclosure Requirements
Auditors will require companies to disclose the rationale behind their categorisation choices, especially for MPMs. This will necessitate more detailed documentation and internal controls around financial reporting.

## Case Study Perspective: The “Adjusted Profit” Transparency

Consider a tech startup that consistently emphasises **”Core Operating Profit”** in its investor presentations by excluding share-based payments and certain legal costs.

* **Under Old Rules:** This “Core” figure existed solely in the presentation deck, often lacking a direct link to the audited profit and loss statement.
* **Under Ind AS 118:** This figure is now a **MPM**.  The company must include a note in its audited financials explaining its calculation and, most importantly, reconciling it to the official “Operating Profit” including the tax impact of those adjustments.

## Next Steps

This standard promotes more disciplined communication.  Companies should start by:

* Reviewing their current profit and loss structure against the five new categories.
* Identifying any MPMs used in previous investor presentations.
* Evaluating whether their internal reporting aligns with the proposed “Operating Profit” definition.
* Engaging with their IT teams to plan necessary adjustments to financial reporting systems.

## Conclusion  
Ind AS 118 represents a significant step towards enhancing the clarity and comparability of financial statements in India. While it introduces new challenges for companies, it ultimately benefits investors and analysts by providing a more standardized and transparent view of financial performance. Early preparation and understanding of the new requirements will be crucial for a smooth transition when the standard takes effect in 2027.
