# The "Free" iPhone Illusion: Unpacking Revenue Recognition under Ind AS 115 & IFRS 15

## Executive Summary

In the consumer world, **"free"** is a powerful marketing hook. A telecom provider offers you the latest flagship smartphone for **$0 upfront** if you simply commit to a 24-month contract at **$50 per month**. You walk out of the store happy, phone in hand, wallet unopened.

But at the telecom company's headquarters, the CFO is navigating a complex accounting landscape. Under the legacy rules (IAS 18), if you billed the customer $0, you booked $0 revenue. Today, **Ind AS 115** (and its global counterparts **IFRS 15** and **US GAAP ASC 606**) has introduced a fundamental disconnect between **Billing (Cash)** and **Revenue (Performance)**.

## 1. The Core Concept: Performance Obligations (PO)

The heart of the new standard is the **Performance Obligation**. A contract is no longer viewed as a single stream of revenue; it is a bundle of distinct promises.

In a standard telecom bundle, the provider makes two distinct promises:

- **The Hardware:** Transfer of the handset
  *(Satisfied at a point in time — Day 1)*
- **The Service:** Provision of network access
  *(Satisfied over time — 24 months)*

The standard dictates that revenue must be recognized as each PO is satisfied.
Therefore, you must recognize revenue for the handset on **Day 1**, even if the invoice handed to the customer says **$0**.

## 2. The Math: Allocating the Transaction Price

To determine the revenue amount, we use the **Relative Standalone Selling Price (SSP)** method. We cannot simply assign arbitrary values; we must look at what the components would sell for individually.

### The Scenario Data

- **Contract Terms:** $50/month for 24 months
- **Total Transaction Price (TTP):** $1,200

### The Standalone Reality

- **Handset SSP:** $800 (price without contract)
- **Service SSP:** $25/month (SIM-only equivalent) → $600 total

---

### Step 1: Determine Total Fair Value (SSP)

- {Total SSP} = $800 {Phone} + $600 {Service} = $1,400

---

### Step 2: Calculate Allocation Ratio

The customer is receiving a package worth **$1,400** for a price of **$1,200**
(a discount of approximately **14.3%**). This discount must be allocated proportionally across all obligations.

- **Handset Allocation:**
  ($800/$1,400) * $1,200 = $685.71
- **Service Allocation:**
  ($600/$1,400) * $1,200 = $514.29
  *(Approx. $21.43/month)*

---

## 3. The Accounting Disconnect

This is where the **"Free iPhone Trap"** manifests in the financial statements.

### On Day 1 (Handset Delivery)

You hand over the phone and invoice **$0**.

- **Credit:** Revenue — $685.71
